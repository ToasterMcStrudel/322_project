The program (we believe) will only work in Visual Studio due to its use of Winforms.
The program just consists of typing in a simple textbox and hitting buttons to execute functions.
Currently only Torikatsu has a hard-coded price (15.95), so that it demonstrates the error catching of finding items without prices listed. It could be a very important failsafe for a restaurant.

Currently the program only demonstrates our Trends Stats Management component, including a Database class and a TrendCalculator class.
